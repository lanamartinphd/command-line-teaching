## Catalogue of resources providing first-time learners with basic knowledge of command line 

Researchers in the life sciences and medical sciences increasingly rely on applications that lack a graphical interface and require typing commands through a terminal rather than using a mouse and graphical interface (GUI). Scientists who are not trained in computer science face an enormous challenge in analyzing high-throughput data. 

We have prepared online catalogue of resources and published papers providing first-time learners with basic knowledge of command line.
The catalogue was prepared for our study "Addressing the digital divide in contemporary biology: Lessons from teaching UNIX"  [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2017.06.007](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2017.06.007)
